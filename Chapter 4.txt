#Story Time
	In old age, Timmy made it big in the stock market. Turns out, when he was a young adult, he had bought quite a few Apple stocks and Google stocks. Timmy sold all those stocks when he was 70 years old, making himself $15 million. With his money, Timmy bought a house in the Hills, a Bugatti and married Sierra Skye. One day, when he was driving his Bugatti on interstate 5 on his way to San Francisco, he decided to open it up and see how fast the Bugatti could really go. Before long, Timmy was zipping along at 250 mph, bobbing and weaving between the traffic. He was reminiscing on his childhood fantasy of being a racecar driver, believing that he was the king of the streets. Anyway, before long, Timmy started to get even more reckless, and he started to have trouble controlling the car. As he went over a bump in the road, Timmy went airborne. The Bugatti flew through the air, spinning as it fell towards the ground. Timmy's Bugatti lande dupside down, caving in the roof, and severely injuring Timmy.

	Timmy began to come to, the blackness that was hindering his sight was slowly replaced with the sea of red that was covering his body and car. The repetitive throb of his pulse was all timmy could hear as he slowly started to move his broken body. With each breath came a sharp stab of pain in his chest. Out of the corner of his blurry field of view he saw a yellow and black clad hand opening his driver side door. As the door opened a blinding blade of light swept over timmy. Squinitng, timmy could see the distinct shape of a firefighters helmet in front of him. "Oh crap!" timmy said aloud."I mustve left my mixtape playing!"
