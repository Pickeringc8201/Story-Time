#Story Time
In old age, Timmy made it big in the stock market. Turns out, when he was a young adult, he had bought quite a few Apple stocks and Google stocks. Timmy sold all those stocks when he was 70 years old, making himself $15 million. With his money, Timmy bought a house in the Hills, a Bugatti and married Sierra Skye. One day, when he was driving his Bugatti on interstate 5 on his way to San Francisco, he decided to open it up and see how fast the Bugatti could really go. Before long, Timmy was zipping along at 250 mph, bobbing and weaving between the traffic. He was reminiscing on his childhood fantasy of being a racecar driver, believing that he was the king of the streets. Anyway, before long, Timmy started to get even more reckless, and he started to have trouble controlling the car. As he went over a bump in the road, Timmy went airborne. The Bugatti flew through the air, spinning as it fell towards the ground. Timmy's Bugatti lande dupside down, caving in the roof, and severely injuring Timmy.
