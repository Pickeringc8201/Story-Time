#Story Time
As an adult, Timmy began to reflect on the many events that implacted him when he was young. 
He looked back at his days in high school and college, and the a feeling of regret started to overcome
him, his 47 year old lungs started to inhale and exhale sharply, memories of his pathetic teenage self
 fused with his anger with towards his current monotonous job and his abusive boss, creating a concotion
 of self hate and regret. Timmy was having a mid life crisis. 
 
 It was bad. Timmy was going through his days
 depressed and discombobulated. His mid-life crisis reached its climax when Timmy decided to buy himself
 a brand new Maserati. It was beautiful, and Timmy looked so good riding around town in it. There was one
 problem, though; the car cost $120,000 and Timmy didn't have that much money. He decided that he would only
 be happy if he had the car, and used his kids' college funds to purchase it.
